All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed (2026-09-13, PRs #13–#28)
- Extraction quality, measured on the corpus runners in `benchmark/`: WCXB dev routed
  0.820 → 0.853, WCXB test 0.856, Zyte article-extraction 0.895 → 0.928, reading-order
  discriminating pairs 0.505 → 0.936. `docs/SESSION-16-LIVE-HARDENING.md` lists every fix
  with its number and the experiments that were rejected.
- `Document.text` no longer includes image alt text or media placeholders; they remain in
  the Markdown. Callers that relied on alt text in `text` should read the Markdown.
- Screen-reader-only labels (`sr-only`, `visually-hidden`, …) are stripped at parse time.
- Comments under an article are stripped unless the comments are the page; forum pages keep
  them. `<aside>` landmarks are stripped unless they name themselves as callouts.
- Cookie-consent dialogs and named filter panels are stripped (`Block.widget`).
- Product pages get a sheet policy (reviews and related grids pruned, `Label: value` lines
  kept); product and collection pages refuse a run under a quarter of the page.
- The renderer marks floats (`data-wg-float`) and hidden elements (`data-wg-hidden`); floats
  are read as one unit and hidden twins dropped.
- MediaWiki pages are routed by namespace; edit-section strips are removed.
- Repository: pull request and issue templates, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  `SUPPORT.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, Dependabot; `CONTRIBUTING.md` states the test-per-fix and
  measurement rules.

### Added
- Extraction engine: geometric reading-order recovery, rich Markdown rendering, JSON-schema
  mapping with provenance, technology fingerprinting, unlimited route discovery and
  cross-page site-chrome removal.
- FastAPI service exposing single-page extraction and a streamed whole-site pipeline.
- Next.js 16 front end: photographic landing page and a dedicated `/extract` run view with
  Discovered / Queued / Extracted / Failed tabs over the live crawl.
- Benchmarks for extraction quality and for route discovery against a real-browser oracle.
